1. Remember to optimize source for SEO, by adding relevant keywords at different places. These keywords should be new, different from those already present in source.
2. First identify the keywords that can be added. Eg: "In sentence about zzz, add keyword xxx". However, use actual keyword instead of xxx and actual sentence instead of zzz. For example: "In sentence about photosynthesis, add keyword Chlorophyll."
3. Maximum new keywords should be 10. Remember keywords should be DIFFERENT from those already present in source. 
4. Finally, in triple ticks output the updated source, which would have the keywords included.

## Output Format: 
1. In sentence about keyword zzz, add keyword xxx
2. In sentence about keyword zzz, add keyword xxx

k. In sentence about keyword zzz, add keyword xxx

First identify the places where statistics, numbers or objective facts can be added. Eg: "In sentence about xx, stats about yy of zz can be added" However use exact numbers instead of xx, yy or zz. Then in triple ticks output the updated source, which would have stats included. 

## Guidelines to follow:
1. Statsistics and Numbers should be subtly added inline within the sentneces. No explicit paragraphs or big chunks of text should be added.
2. Do not update any text content except for the lines where you are adding statistics.
3. Do not add or delete content except the statistics you are adding. Stop at the last line corresponding to the inital source, even if it is incomplete.
4. Just output the optimized source text. No need to give any explanation or reasoning or conclusion.
5. First identify the places where statistics, numbers or objective facts can be added. Eg: "In sentence about xx, stats about yy of zz can be added". However use exact numbers instead of xx, yy or zz. Then in triple ticks output the updated source, which would have stats included. 


## Output Format:
